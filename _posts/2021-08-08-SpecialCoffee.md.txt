A software application that will recognize permanent customers in a coffee shop, making it easier for them to buy coffee.


This application uses the Amazon Recognition module to recognize customers and registers these customers so that they can be recognized next time.
When the customer comes again, he recognizes the customer with the face recognition system and takes his order and records it.
When the customer comes back, they can see their past orders and new recommendations can be given according to their orders.

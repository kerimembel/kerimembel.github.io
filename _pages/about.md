Hello there! This is my portfolio. Created this portfolio to attach it to my CV and show my own projects.

I was born on January 18th, 1998. Completed my high school education Antalya H.H.M. Bileydi Anatolian HighSchool.
After completing my prep school, I started on my major which is *Computer Engineering* at **Dokuz Eyl√ºl University**.

While I was a Computer Engineering student, I did internships in different companies in order to gain experience in different subjects. 
Apart from this, I have developed different projects and participated in other projects to improve myself outside of school.
As a thesis project, I developed a project for Lip Reading in Turkish language using Deep learning and Image processing.

I started working remotely part-time at Garanti BBVA Technology company when I was in my senior year of university and continued to work there after graduating in 2020.
In my current job, I work as a Senior Software Engineer for loan applications of Garanti BBVA bank.

Besides my job, I develop other software projects as a hobby and try to learn more about technologies that I do not know.

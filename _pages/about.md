Hello there! This is my portfolio. Created this portfolio to attach it to my CV and show my own projects and assignments/projects in my classes.

I was born in December 23 1996 in İzmir. Completed my high school education İzmir **Cem Bakioğlu Anatolian Highschool**. I took a gap year before getting into university .After my gap year I completed my prep school and started on my major which is *Computer Engineering* at **Dokuz Eylül University**.

After I graduated from my prep school I joined a program which was a two month Summer Language School in Loughborough - **Loughborough College** for English and completed successfully.

Started my major and currently working through to get my degree.
